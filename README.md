# MSBA-6421 - Practice-Predictive-Analytics  

## ðŸ“Œ About This Repository  
This repository is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks documenting my **hands-on learning** of various **Machine Learning techniques**. Each notebook explores a different ML concept with practical implementation.

## Notebooks Overview  

### 1. **Notebook_1:**  
#### Feature Selection & Hyperparameter Tuning 
Techniques covered:  
-  **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** â€“ Selecting the most relevant features by iteratively removing the least important ones.  
-  **GridSearchCV** â€“ Automating hyperparameter tuning using different parameter combinations.  
-  **K-Fold Cross-Validation** â€“ Improving model generalization by evaluating it across multiple data splits.  

### 2. **Notebook2:**
#### Ordinal Variable Treatment & Model Performance Analysis
- Evaluate the impact of treating ordinal variables as numeric vs categorical on model performance.

Techniques Covered:

- **Numeric vs Categorical Treatment** â€“ Comparing the effect of encoding ordinal variables differently.
- **Nested Cross-Validation** â€“ Using inner and outer loops for unbiased hyperparameter tuning and model selection.
- **Learning Curve Analysis** â€“ Understanding model behavior by plotting accuracy against the training set size.
- **GridSearchCV** â€“ Hyperparameter tuning to find the best model configuration.
- **Model Evaluation** â€“ Testing the final model on a holdout dataset (20%) to check generalization.
