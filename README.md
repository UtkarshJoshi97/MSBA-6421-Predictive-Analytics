# Practice-Predictive-Analytics  

## ðŸ“Œ About This Repository  
This repository is a collection of Jupyter Notebooks documenting my **hands-on learning** of various **Machine Learning techniques**. Each notebook explores a different ML concept with practical implementation.

## Notebooks Overview  

### 1. **Notebook_1:**  
#### Feature Selection & Hyperparameter Tuning 
Techniques covered:  
-  **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)** â€“ Selecting the most relevant features by iteratively removing the least important ones.  
-  **GridSearchCV** â€“ Automating hyperparameter tuning using different parameter combinations.  
-  **K-Fold Cross-Validation** â€“ Improving model generalization by evaluating it across multiple data splits.  

ðŸ“Œ *More notebooks will be added as I explore new techniques!*
